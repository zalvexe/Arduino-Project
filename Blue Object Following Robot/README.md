# Blue Object Following Robot

## Description : 
Simple object recognition with Arduino Uno and OpenCV in C++. This project intentionally made for my robotic final project.   
It uses 2 Arduino unos for wireless connection. For webcam, i use my phone connected with the OpenCV trough Iriun virtual webcam.  
Honestly it was pretty complicated project to made cause we need to use c++ instead of python.. ;_;
